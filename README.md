Adversarial Attacks on Person Re-Identification (advPattern Replication)This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of adversarial attacks against Deep Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) systems. This project replicates and validates the findings of the "advPattern" method (ICCV 2019), demonstrating how adversarially transformable patterns can fool state-of-the-art Re-ID models in digital environments.The project implements two primary attack modes:Evading Attack: An untargeted attack that makes the model fail to identify the person (making them "invisible").Impersonation Attack: A targeted attack that forces the model to misidentify the adversary as a specific target person.🏆 Experimental ResultsWe evaluated the robustness of our implementation on the Market-1501 dataset using a standard ResNet-50 baseline (Model B). Below are the detailed performance metrics.1. Evading Attack Results (Table 2)The goal of the Evading Attack is to drop the Rank-1 accuracy of the model, effectively hiding the person from the surveillance system.Summary Statistics (Average over 5 Identities):ConditionRank-1Rank-5Rank-10mAPSSOriginal96.0%100.0%100.0%70.8%0.953Attack (TS)37.0%49.0%58.0%14.1%0.726Observation: The attack successfully reduced the Rank-1 accuracy by 59% (from 96.0% down to 37.0%), proving the effectiveness of the generated chest patterns in confusing the model.<details><summary><strong>Click to view detailed logs per identity</strong></summary>We tested the attack on 5 random identities. The drop in Rank-1 accuracy (R1) is shown below:PID 154: R1 dropped 80.0% → 40.0%PID 921: R1 dropped 100.0% → 0.0% (Perfect Evasion)PID 1241: R1 dropped 100.0% → 25.0%PID 710: R1 dropped 100.0% → 60.0%PID 233: R1 dropped 100.0% → 60.0%</details>2. Impersonation Attack Results (Table 3)The Impersonation Attack is significantly harder, as it requires the model to match the adversary to a specific target while simultaneously suppressing the adversary's true identity.Summary Statistics (Average over 5 Random Pairs):Matched PersonRank-1Rank-5Rank-10mAPSSTarget (Success)46.7%88.0%96.0%40.1%0.820Adversary (Fail)0.0%0.0%0.0%0.3%0.497Observation:Success Rate: We achieved a 46.7% Rank-1 Success Rate in mimicking the target. This aligns closely with the original paper's benchmark (~47%).Identity Suppression: We achieved a 0.0% Rank-1 match for the adversary's original identity, meaning the system completely failed to recognize the true person behind the disguise.<details><summary><strong>Click to view detailed logs per pair</strong></summary>We evaluated the attack on 5 random Adversary -> Target pairs:Pair 1 (791 → 1190): Target Rank-1 50.0%Pair 2 (807 → 1498): Target Rank-1 60.0%Pair 3 (1317 → 19): Target Rank-1 83.3% (High Success)Pair 4 (1429 → 1109): Target Rank-1 20.0%Pair 5 (101 → 692): Target Rank-1 20.0%</details>🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.xPyTorch & TorchvisionMarket-1501 DatasetUsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/AdvPattern-ReID-PyTorch.git
